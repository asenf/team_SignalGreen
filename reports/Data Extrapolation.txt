DATA EXTRAPOLATION
Data extrapolation was implemented into the simulation. This allowed for 
comparisons of difference and efficiency between various maps that the 
simulation emulates. The implementation starts with recording data from 
data sources. These are predefined and, aggregate or non-aggregate. 

They are in the form of linked hash maps and levy Repast’s integrated 
ability to pass agents and objects towards the correct data source. For 
instance, the simulation model records an aggregate data source for average 
speed. This data source calls the getVelocity() method of all vehicle 
agents in the simulation at each time step. The aggregate operation 
carried out on the results of getVelocity() is attaining the mean. 

To assist in this, Repast has a data set descriptor 
repast.simphony.data2.engine.DataSetDescriptor to define the datasets 
that are being created and is in XML.

To visualize the extrapolated data being collected from the data sources, 
the data is plotted against tick count on a time series type chart. Repast 
has an integrated ability to create various charts from the data sources 
defined. For instance, in the case of the average speed of vehicles, the 
descriptor below was used to define attributes of a time series chart, 
where the x-axis has the tick count and y-axis has the mean speed. This 
is shown in figure xx. The descriptor is defined in XML and is 
repast.simphony.chart2.engine.TimeSeriesChartDescriptor.

The simulation stores data collected from the data sources and writes 
the data into a sink text file. This makes use of Repast’s ability to 
write data to both file and console. Each data source is assigned a data 
set ID which helps separate the data and write each ID in a set column. 
The follow shows resultant data stored for average speed. As seen in the 
output, the sink file structures the data collected from each data 
source in a tabular format.
