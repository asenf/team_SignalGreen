\section{PROJECT DESCRIPTION}


\subsection{AIMS FOR PROJECT}

Our aim is to create a traffic simulation software where we can test various traffic management strategies that will teach us new skills and receive full marks. 
\\ \\
This means we will demonstrate our ability to use GitHub and other common engineering tools to create a vehicle simulation. It includes working together as a team and learning from each other. We will experience developing a software that is bigger than any of us could have created by ourselves in the given time. 


\subsection{STRATEGY}

\subsubsection{SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS}

During the first week we analysed the specifications and identified a set of requirements, which we broke down into two levels of priorities. The software will be delivered in three incremental releases - the Milestones. The project is to be considered successful from v2.0 on. The following is a high level schema:

\begin{itemize}
    \item High priority requirements: to be implemented for project success. Two main releases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item V1.0 release will implement core features: 23rd Feb.
        \item V2.0 will implement remaining features: 18th Mar.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Low priority requirements: to be implemented after v2.0 has been released and successfully tested:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item V3.0 will implement some of the optional features: 25th Mar.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
SCRUM is the methodology of choice as it provides the ability to quickly react to problems minimizing risks of failure. Furthermore, given that we all work/study full-time, SCRUM provides the transparency that is essential to know at any stage that the project is on track.


\subsubsection{PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT}

After forming the teams we conducted some research in order to decide how to medel the software and consequently which tools would provide the most effective environment.
\\ \\
Firstly, we decided to use Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) against Object Oriented Programming (OOP) because we can model the system as a set of interacting agents (such as cars and traffic lights) which exist on an environment (the road network) and are capable behavioural adaptation, providing a realistic simulation.
\\ \\
Of the shortlisted ABM frameworks, we decided to use the RePast Simphony 2.2 framework. It is flexible, allows module replacement if we desire, and is more recent than RePastJ. As IDE we are using the Eclipse editor because it comes set up with Simphony and it is commonly used.
\\ \\
We further considered and decided against using NetLogo, coding the ABM software ourselves, and RePastJ. 
We decided coding an entire ABM software ourselves would not leave sufficient time to complete other project requirements. Although NetLogo has many preexisting models, it is rather restrictive; there was also concern about the final appearance of the project.
We decided against RePastJ because it is an older version than Simphony.
\\ \\
Finally, we agreed on using Java because everyone on the team is experienced in using it and java is commonly used for similar applications in industry.
Its ease of use compared to C++ will help us expedite programming progress.

\subsubsection{COMMUNICATION TOOLS}

We are communicating and documenting via WhatsApp, asana and Instagantt, and thus 
far we have held weekly team meetings in person at KCL to discuss research and divide tasks.
\\ \\
Every week team members report on work done via asana to ensure progress is continually being made. Asana is connected to Instagantt, where we can see the corresponding Gantt chart of our progress.
\\ \\
The week of 23 February our program will (at minimum) run a basic simulation, and the group will assess our progress and set final goals and specifications for our finished project.

\subsection{CURRENT PROGRESS}

Our team is functioning on GitHub and we are currently coding the architecture and 
environment. The basics of choosing and learning new enviornments is complete, and we
are now focused on making progress with the program itself and continuing documentation. 
We have coded the Road Network as well as the Car and Junction classes, which will be committed on GitHub after proper testing.

\section{PROJECT ORGANISATION}

\subsection{TEAM WORK}

We communicate in person and via our selected communication tools.  Team members 
volunteer or recommend peers for tasks that play to that team member's strength or where 
that person would like to learn new skills.


\subsection{ROLES}

James and Yoann are focusing on the program architecture and vehicle classes. Waqar and 
Adeela are focusing on creating the road map components. Andrea is coordinator for GitHub 
purposes and is creating documentation and reporting. All team members will participate 
in testing and analysis.


\subsection{PEER ASSESSMENT}

We expect everyone to carry roughly equal amounts of work and so we plan to divide team 
points equally between us. If we have concerns that this is not happening, we will 
discuss it so there will not be surprises in our assessment of each other at the end of term.


\subsection{CONFLICTS}

Concerns or issues between team members should be discussed between the members within 
a reasonable time of noticing the problem. This is to prevent surprises about members' 
evaluation of each other at the end of the project, and to minimize friction between 
group members.
\\ \\
We anticipate the load should be shared fairly equally between members and 
this is considered when taking tasks during team meetings. If a member feels 
they are doing more work than others, this should be communicated to the group so action 
can be taken while there is time to remedy the issue.
