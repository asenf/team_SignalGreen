/* Because simphony only seems to care about nodes not edges, my idea for implemnting proper,
decentralised BDI(more advanced form of agents) is to have something along these lines */


class MainEdge extends a proper repast edge I think.
	Node source
	Node target
	float weight
	int lanes(ambitiuous...)

	from this, we devide to the edge into subsections, so that a car can only see a section ahead of it.
	Queue<SubEdges>(10) //can divide length from constructor to get exact amount,

Instead of using the watcher, which is a centralised view and not really agents
this allows each agent to percieve the enviroment itself, and act accordingly, to its beliefs.

modularilised well enough as an interface perhaps this could work with most things.


I-ll start on the code tomo
